:memo: Today I Learned

We at Stakater constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.

For new TILs, watch this repo

# About

We stole this idea from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). Previously we had been gathering our learnings in a single gist but we hit the limit of comments on a gist; and we couldn't open our gist anymore!
